# Core-tower-defence-game
This is my F454 A2 computing project. 

If you want you can try out the game at https://itdebicki.com/ca/main.html


The version I submitted with my controlled assesment can be found under the 'ca' branch.

Feel free to fork and take the code. I will be working on it periodically as a side project.

The recommended browser to play this game on is chrome version 46 or newer

My current expansion work will relate to:

- Balance the maps properly
- Fix some graphical errors
- Implement a small bio for users to add
- Add an online map creator so user can create and share maps
- Improve browser compatibility
